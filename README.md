# CS-360-Inventory-App

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements of this app were to design a functional inventory app that interacts with an SQLite DB to insert, update, and delete inventory based on the user input.
This app also supports SMS alerts when inventory is running low and it includes a sign in screen with account creation.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A login screen, main item screen, add/delete/update item screen, and SMS permissions screen were needed to support easy UI navigation for the users. I kept my UI simple
with a few buttons that clearly indicate what the use is for. My design allows users to easily navigate through the screens.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached coding my app by laying out a class diagram so I could see what methods and variables were needed for each class. I will continue to use this method in the future
as it makes for an easy picture of what is needed out of the app and how to get started.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I ensured that my code was functional by using the android emulator for testing anytime I implemented a new method or call back. This is an important step as if I continued
to develop the app without testing it I wouldn't have known what parts of the app weren't working properly. For example, I had trouble with getting the recyclerview to inflate
and if I didn't test my code I wouldn't have known to start there.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate whne it came to developing the overall layout of the app as it was my first time desiging UI for a functional app and thinking of the best processes
required some research and creativity.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I thought I did a good job at demonstrating my knowledge and skills through the completion of my add/delete buttons which interacted with different screens and allowed for 
user input to work with the SQLite DB to update items.
